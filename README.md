# Hi! 👋

I am currently working at MSU RCC-LAIR as an NLP Researcher, participating in [ruadapt](https://github.com/RefalMachine/ruadapt) project and other IR research.

## Education 🎓
- 2021-2025 **Bachelor of Computer Science and Mathematics**, MSU CMC
- 2025-present time **Masters of Computer Science and Mathematics**, MSU CMC

## Projects 🤖
- 2024-present time: [RusBEIR](https://github.com/kaengreg/rusBeIR) - comprehensive benchmark designed for zero-shot evaluation of information retrieval (IR) models in the Russian language
- 2024 **Coursework**: Methods for distilling large language models
- 2024-2025 [**Diploma**](https://github.com/kaengreg/layer-wise_distillation): Approaches for LLM distillation and their practical applications
- 2025-present time: [WikiFacts-Bench](https://github.com/kaengreg/wikifacts-bench) - multilingual Wikipedia-based dataset and framework for RAG benchmark
- 2025-present time: [ruadapt](https://github.com/RefalMachine/ruadapt) - framework for adaptation of Large Language Models to Russian Language
